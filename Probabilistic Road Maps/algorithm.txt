1. Repeat n times
2.  Generate a random point in configuration space, x
3.  If x is in freespace
4.    Find the k closest points in the roadmap to x according to the Dist function
5.    Try to connect the new random sample to each of the k neighbors using the LocalPlanner procedure. 
6.      Each successfulconnection forms a new edge in the graph.
